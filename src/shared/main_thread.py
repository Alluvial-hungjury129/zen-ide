"""Thread-safe dispatch to the GTK main thread.

GLib 2.86+ has stricter assertions that crash when GLib.idle_add() is called
from non-main threads. This module provides a safe alternative using a
queue + main-thread poll timer.

Setup (call once from main thread during app init):
    from shared.main_thread import start_main_thread_poll
    start_main_thread_poll()

Usage (from any thread):
    from shared.main_thread import main_thread_call
    main_thread_call(my_callback, arg1, arg2)
